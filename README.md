# Code_Clause_Internship-TASK-2

This is the **TASK 2 of Code_Clause Internship**. Here I deployed a **URL Shortener Website**.
An **URL shortener** is a website that reduces the length of your URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The idea is to minimize the web page address into something that's easier to remember and track.


**Usage**
>Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
>Enter a long URL in the input field and click the "Shorten" button.
>The shortened URL will be displayed, and you can copy it to share.


**Features**
>Shorten long URLs.
>Redirect users to the original URL when they visit the shortened link.
>Track the number of times a shortened link has been used.


**Contributing**
